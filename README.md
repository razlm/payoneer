# Payoneer Counter Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Payoneer Counter Project! This project aims to provide a simple web service that maintains a counter of the amount of POST requests it serves.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a web service, "counter-service," written in Python, deployed using Docker, and managed by Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
It has webhook trigger for any branch,
Any branch other then 'main' will create a new docker deploy it wait 10 sec and close it.
In main branch changes it will delete the old counter-app and build the new container and deploy it.
